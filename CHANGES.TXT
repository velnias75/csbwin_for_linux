Hi Paul,


I don't know but I still tend to call you Steve. Sorry if I made this mistake.


So, here's the changes list. These changes are required in order to compile it successfully on my computer.


-Tomas



global: these conditionals should read (turns off annoying warning)



  #ifndef _LINUX ---> #if !defined(_LINUX) && !defined(TARGET_OS_MAC)
  #pragma warning (disable:4710)
  #endif


or better


  #ifdef _MSVC_INTEL
  #pragma warning (disable:4710)
  #endif

I forward this from Rebecka:


The "official" Linux version cannot run Conflux, but our local version
can. We didn't have to alter many things to makt it work, but there are a
few issues:


Character case in Filenames... this is especially an issue with the extra
graphics in the subdirectory Portraits. We did something like this in
Bitmaps.cpp...


+#ifdef _LINUX
+  sprintf(filename2,"Portrait%03d.bmp",index);M
+  sprintf(filename1,"portraits/Portrait%03d.bmp",index);M
+#else
   sprintf(filename2,"Portrait%03d.BMP",index);M
   sprintf(filename1,"portraits\\Portrait%03d.BMP",index);M
+#endif


...but this will only work with conflux, unless there is a naming sheme
for the graphics in new dungeons.
Btw, I think Win32 open(filename) can handle "/" as delimiters just as
well as "\\". Linux can not do this, perhaps we could use "/" for both
windows and linux?




Then there is the second issue: The same file (Bitmaps.cpp) use two
windows specific structures BITMAPINFOHEADER and BITMAPFILEHEADER. We
copied these structs into Types.h, but perhaps a better way would be to
copy them into Bitmaps.cpp and rename them to something like
CSB_BITMAPINFOHEADER and CSB_BITMAPFILEHEADER.


I don't know how well this works for macintosh... ANSI C explicitly
forbids you to read a structure directly from a binary file. They want you
to go through the painful work of loading each struct member one by one.
If the MAC compiler honours #pragma pack, then this should not be a
problem.


Bitmaps.cpp could start with
#include<all includes>
#pragma pack(1)
//copy of BITMAPINFOHEADER goes here
#pragma pack




These changes are the only ones you need to make in the "shared" code to
make the linux version happy.



About the future... will you add support to use external sounds?


I would be interested in making a "dinner table" for a dungeon we are
creating. Is this possible with this version of CSB?


The "dinner table" would work like a huge alcove, but visible from all
sides. It would cover a whole cell, and things would be placeable on top
of it just like a floor tile.
