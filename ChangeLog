	Version 12.100v0 corrects hint oracle bug:
	Earlier versions crashed, if too many "hint items" were present.
	Only "src/Hint.cpp", version numbering and documentation changed.
[Christoph] 111122-111127
	New version is 12.0; updated from Windows version 11.067,
	minor changes to make it compile on Linux (x86) out of
	the box again.
	Hermes not included, because detection fails for me.
	Sound is half-broken, as well as window-resize.
[Maciej] 110805   .deb package: 110902

[Rebecka] 061017
	Esd broken again.
[Rebecka] 061015
	* Various minor tweaks. Added the "soundpipe" ability,
	because esd-support apparently has been broken with newer versions
	of esd. One "quicky-fix" have been added because of this,
	only one channel of esd is supported.
[Martin] ????
	Support for the Nokia 770.
[Erik]	051001
	* Updated CSBlinux to somewhat 150 CSBwin-versions later.
	CSBwin/linux now counts as version 9.9.
	* Rebecka included a function that asks esd if the sound
	pipe floods over or not. If it does, the sound is cut.
[Erik]	040906
	* Updated code from windows version 9.8
[Rebecka] 040219
	* Updated code from windows version 9.7
	* Fixed a chrash when playing Conflux2.
	* Patch to handle absolute pathways correctly.
	* AITrace included.
	* AUDIO now uses 16 channels to prevent "sound lag".
	Would have been a more "atarish" fix to simply cut the sounds short,
	but esd doesn't support this.
	* Improved support for systems whithout libHermes.
