--Character name substitution in Floor Text.
--Added third-party code to use DirectX.  Added menu 
item to enable DirectX usage.
--Remove 'FORMAT" button on save game menu.

deal with large dungeons.  Especially 64-level dungons!
--Queue sounds so they are not lost when two play at
same time.
--Allow 64-level dungeons.

end of allocated string buffer.

MonsterAITrace, ItemsRemaining, Non-CSBItemsRemainin
when playing encrypted dungeon.
--Ignore pits above non-existent places.
--Command-Line option to control speed.

party is dead.  (Disable Ghost trick)

to communicate game version, story line, etc to the player.

display them text-first except when directly adjacent to
the party.  And in that case we supress the 'joint-removal'.
--Menu to select sound volume
--'Wiggle' objects on a pit only when the pit goes from a closed

They should work properly now.

--Don't crash after warning user about illegal actuator target.
--Remove debug code from 9.6t.  Otherwise nothing works.

removing from the character's hand which caused its weight
to not be removed from the character's load.  Keys were not
too much of a problem but Conflux had much heavier 'keys'.
--Confine Wall-Tapping noise to the wall immediately in front
of the party.
--Do not create type zero Timer entries.  Warn the player
once and then be quiet about it.  Don't issue warning in
Playback mode.
--Don't announce 'Illegal Wall Graphic' if in Playback mode.
--Attempt to correct wall-tapping.  Non-blocking Trick Wall
no longer causes tapping sound.
--Survive Flagged-Empty-Cells.  These are cells marked as
containing one or more objects but which ar in fact empty.

warning and then be quiet and tolerant.  Throw away excess.

==============================================================
Version 9.6

Repaired distorted graphic of 'EVIL-OUTSIDE' at a distance of 3.
This was an error in the graphics files.

Clear screen when changing screen sizes.

Double linefeed in scrolls now results in a blank line instead
of the letter 'J'.

Allow Anti-Fire and -Magic to operate as it appears was intended
by original designers.  (Byte/word problem).

Survive illegal Champion Portrait text.  Substitute "BOGUS"/"ILLEGAL HERO"
and minimal stats.

Fullscreen capability.

Ignore doors and teleporters in stone walls.

Prevent 'grave-robbing' by disallowing party traveling through
solid stone walls.

Detect infinite actuator loop and die gracefully.

Implement DM rules option.  Affects 'reincarnation' stats.

Fix crash in 'Misc|Items Remaining' when a Screamer is carrying
a Rock Pile.

Remove check for size-four monster positions.

Don't delete objects marked as 'Cloned'.

19June03

When placing object in cell search entire list for actuator.

Add sound when monster drops weapon.  This was a bug on my part.

21June03

Check position of size 4 monsters.  They must have positons
of 3,3,3,3 to be visible.  If incorrect I change it silently.

Limit Wall Text to 18 characters per line to avoid strange
things from happening.

Added 'List All Items Remaining'.  Like the old 'Items Remaining'
except that it does not assume the CSB dungeon.

Fix 'Divide-by-zero' crash when Luck is zero.

22Jun03

Fix another Divide-by-zero problem when Maximum Attribute = 0;

Fix crash when party is struck by fireball.  Atari code released
the database entry before extracting tht timer index.  This was
broken when I put in the code to not release cloned objects.

Remove warning about size two monsters being improperly positioned.

23 June 2003 AM

Fix walltext causing terrible graphics problems.  This has been
broken for 2-1/2 years!!!  We lucked out.

23 June 2003 PM

Fix removing weight when character eats food.  The original code
released the memory from the database and then referenced it to 
get the weight.  It also referenced it for many other purposes!
