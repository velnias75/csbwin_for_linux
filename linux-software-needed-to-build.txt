Package names are from Debian
you need LENNY or SID in your sources-list for Glib 1.2 and GTK+ 1.2
Names are likely similar, but not identical on Redhat-type Linuxes, Suse, etc.

Package names from Debian Squeeze and Lenny:
libglib1.2-dev
libgtk1.2-dev
libesd0-dev
libsdl1.2-dev

The above pull in other required packages via dependencies,
so this list is incomplete.

Things to look for if something is missing:

The GNU C++ compiler
Enlightened Sound Daemon: Esound, ESD
Simple Direct Media Layer: SDL
The Gimp Toolkit: GTK, GTK+
Gnome: Glib

I had no luck in compiling Hermes in to achieve dynamic window resizing.
You'll also notice that sound is far less than optimal.
Help would be appreciated.
